This is a sample Cypress UI test framework which can be used as a template for any cypress UI test automation framework using BDD. This framework implements page object design pattern with each page having designated elements and functions to interact with those elements.
To run the tests on this framework via the terminal, type and press enter (npm run cy:open) is used to launch cypress where a particular feature file can be executed by clicking on that feature file or clicking on Run integration specs to execute all feature files in the Cucumber_Feature_Tests folder
Feature files have to be created on the Cucumber_Feature_Tests folder and a subsequent folder created under Cucumber_Feature_Tests folder for the page objects and the corresponding step definitions. The folder needs to have the same name as the feature file i.e. a feature file called x.feature file created under the Cucumber_Feature_Tests. A new folder created x and the corresponding xPage.js and xSteps.js files in it. 
Looking at the folder structure on this framework, we have a Login.feature file, a Login folder which have in it loginPage.js and loginStep.js
